# FlamesFinder

Created by Michael Lyons

FlamesFinder is dynamic application that allows for users to find nearby campgrounds via geoLocation. Once a current location has been given, a list of the 20 closest campgrounds is displayed along with a map showing their proximity. From here the user can select a campground and be taken to a page with the campground info displayed along with the current and future weather displayed. 
(note: you will likely need keys for googleMaps API, OpenWeather Maps API, WeatherUnderground API, and Active API to run this application locally)
